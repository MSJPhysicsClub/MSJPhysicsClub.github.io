We acknowledge that physics currently does not receive as much interest as other academic or nonacademic subjects do. A part of this is due to the fact that in the high school curriculum at Mission, physics class only becomes an option to students when they are in eleventh grade. Furthermore, some who enjoy physics simply do not have anyone to collaborate ideas with. 

MSJ Physics Club serves to not only unify but also nurture and create every studentâ€™s passion for physics. Only through interactions with peers and activities within the club can one truly build this passion. Aside from this, everyone in the MSJ Physics Club will collaboratively sharpen their physics skills. This can be from a variety of our activities, including problem review sessions for the annual f=ma contest, a high school physics contest hosted throughout the nation, lectures on physics concepts, hosting teams for physics bowl and other physics team competitions, etc. 


Please help us reach 200 signatures to start the club. Thanks!

We acknowledge that physics currently does not receive as much interest as 
other academic or nonacademic subjects do. A part of this is due to the fact that 
in the high school curriculum at Mission, physics class only becomes an option to 
students when they are in eleventh grade. Furthermore, some who enjoy physics simply 
do not have anyone to collaborate ideas with.

Please help us reach 200 signatures to start the club. Thanks!

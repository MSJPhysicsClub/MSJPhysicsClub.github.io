The MSJ Physics Club is a student-run club that serves to not only unify but also nurture and create every studentâ€™s 
passion for physics. Only through interactions with peers and activities within the club can one 
truly build this passion. Aside from this, everyone in the MSJ Physics Club will collaboratively 
sharpen their physics skills. This can be from a variety of our activities, including study groups for AP Physics classes and exams,
problem review sessions for the annual f=ma contest, a high school physics contest hosted throughout 
the nation, lectures on physics concepts, hosting teams for physics bowl and other 
physics team competitions, etc.

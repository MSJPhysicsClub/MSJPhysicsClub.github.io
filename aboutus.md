The MSJ Physics Club is a student-run club that serves to unify, nurture, and
create a passion for physics in the MSJ community. Through peer interactions and
club activities, club members will collaboratively sharpen their physics skills and
build a passion for physics that supplements the current curriculum offered by
MSJ. Activities include AP Physics study groups, problem review session for
national physics contests (e.g. F=ma), team formations for physics bowl and other
competitions, lectures on physics concepts, and much more.

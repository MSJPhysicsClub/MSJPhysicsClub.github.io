title: Problem Of The Week
---

Welcome to Problem Of The Week! The MSJ Physics Club Officers will post a physics-related problem each week that can span from conceptual questions to computational physics questions. These questions will typically be in the curriculum of AP Physics 1, AP Physics 2, or AP Physics C, including both Mechanics and E&M. The problem of the week's purpose is to allow students to engage with enlightening and interesting physics problems so that they not only use their critical thinking skills, but also have a chance to collaborate with other peers in the physics club. In each weekly meeting, the officers will present a solution to that week's problem. All problems in a school year will be posted in this page, but we keep the previous years in the archive. The Problem Of The Week will not continue over summer and will restart at the beginning of each school year.

Here is this week's Problem Of The Week:
